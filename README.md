The **Project-Management-Web-App** is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline project management processes. It is divided into two main components: the **Backend** and the **Frontend**.

# **Backend**

The backend is developed using **Node.js** with the **Express.js** framework and utilizes a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage. Key features include:

- **User Management**: Registration, login, and profile management.
- **Project Management**: Creation, modification, and deletion of projects.
- **Task Management**: Addition, modification, and tracking of tasks within projects.
- **Team Management**: Formation of teams, assignment of roles, and permissions.

*Some of these features are currently under development.*

# **Frontend**

The frontend is developed using **React.js** with the **Redux** state management library. It provides an interactive and responsive user interface, enabling users to:

- **View Projects**: Access project lists and their details.
- **Manage Tasks**: Create, modify, and monitor task progress.
- **Collaborate in Real-Time**: Communicate with team members through notifications and real-time updates.

*Some of these features are currently under development.*
